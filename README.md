The authors tackle these challenges by reformulating CNNs for graphs through three interconnected innovations. First, they replace traditional spectral filters with _Chebyshev polynomial approximations_, bypassing the need for computationally expensive eigenvalue decompositions. These polynomials approximate spectral filters while strictly limiting their influence to _K-hop neighborhoods_ around each node, ensuring spatial localization. This reduces computational complexity from quadratic (O(n2)O(n2)) to linear (O(K∣E∣)O(K∣E∣)), critical for sparse, real-world graphs.

Second, they introduce a _graph coarsening strategy_ using the Graclus algorithm, which hierarchically clusters nodes into coarser graphs. This mimics the multi-scale resolution reduction in classical CNNs, enabling pooling operations. By merging nodes based on local normalized cuts, Graclus preserves structural relationships while progressively halving the graph size.

Finally, to enable efficient pooling, nodes are reorganized into a _binary tree structure_. Fake nodes are inserted to regularize unmatched clusters, allowing pooling operations to function analogously to 1D signal pooling. This restructuring ensures memory efficiency and GPU compatibility, bypassing the need for complex lookup tables.
